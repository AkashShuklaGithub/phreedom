<h1 align="center"> Deleting a Supplier Purchase Order</h1>
<p>Purchase  orders can only be deleted if no items have been received from the purchase order. If any items have been received, the corresponding purchase/receipt must be removed before the purchase order can be deleted. In this case, the purchase order should be closed. See Closing a Purchase Order. Closing a purchase order will remove all remaining 'quantity on  order' quantities from inventory. </p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Suppliers Menu, select Purchase Orders. The Purchase Order form will load. </li>
  <li>Press the Open button and a popup will appear listing the purchase orders for the current period. Select the sales order to be deleted and the sales order form will be filled in. <br />
    <br />
    NOTE: Use the period pull down and search box to facilitate locating the desired purchase order.<br /> 
  </li>
  <li>Press the Delete button and confirm the action on the confirmation popup.</li>
</ol>
<p>When a purchase order is deleted, the journal entry is removed from the database and the quantity on  order values are readjusted. This action will not affect the income statement or balance sheet since a purchase order represents an allocation of inventory and not an actual purchase (monetary transaction).</p>
